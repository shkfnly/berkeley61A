This is a repository of all the work I did while auditing Berkeley's primary CS course 61A. The course work is primarily in Python and follows the outline given by `http://composingprograms.com`in the course we covered functions, recursions, algorithms, functional programming, OOP, and declaritive languages.

There were 4 primary projects for the game.

## Hog
Hog was a probability based game involving a die, and we had to design an algorithm that would efficiently play the game and produce the correct result the optimal number of times.

## Trends
Used twitter data and performed syntaxtical analysis in order to discern sentiments of tweets

## Ants
Was a object oriented game involving many classes and instances to create the final product which was a graphical playable game with multiple characted types. Implementation consisted of specifically of game logic

## Scheme
The task was to build a scheme interpreter in python.

**Note this repository has all the class materials for the course.
